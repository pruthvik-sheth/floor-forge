### Frontend (React)

- Single-page application built with React and Vite
- Responsive UI with modern design principles
- State management using React hooks

### Backend (Python/Flask)

- RESTful API built with Flask
- Stable Diffusion model for floor plan generation
- File storage for generated images and metadata

## üîß Technologies

### Frontend

- React
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite

### Backend

- Python
- Flask
- PyTorch
- Diffusers (Hugging Face)
- Stable Diffusion

## üì• Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- Python (v3.8+)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for faster generation)

### Backend Setup

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the backend server
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   The server will start at http://localhost:5000

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   cd floor-forge-frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Enter a description of your desired floor plan in the text area
3. Optionally adjust the generation parameters
4. Click "Generate Floor Plan" and wait for the result
5. Save or download your generated floor plan
